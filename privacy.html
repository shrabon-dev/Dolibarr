            <h2> How we protect your privacy <span>on Thrive Bereau ERP CRM.com and when you use our services</span> </h2> 
            <p>Thrive Bereau ERP CRM SA and its affiliates offer many services to help you run your business, including a platform to host your own Thrive Bereau ERP CRM database. As part of running those services we collect data about you and your business. This data is not only essential to run our services, but also critical for the safety of our services and all our users.
              This policy explains what information is collected, why it is collected, and how we use it. </p>
              <h2>Information we collect</h2>
            <p>Most of the personal data we collect is directly provided by our users when they register and use our services. Other data is collected by recording interactions with our services.</p>
            <p><strong>Account & Contact Data:</strong> When you register on our website to use or download one of our products, or to subscribe to one of our services (Thrive Bereau ERP CRM Online, Free Trial, Thrive Bereau ERP CRM Apps, Thrive Bereau ERP CRM.sh, etc.), or fill in one of our contact forms, you voluntarily give us certain information. This typically includes your name, company name, email address, and sometimes your phone number, postal address (when an invoice or delivery is required),your business sector and interest in Thrive Bereau ERP CRM, as well as a personal password.
              We never record or store credit card information from our customers, and always rely on trusted third-party PCI-DSS-compliant payment processors for credit card processing, including for recurring payment processing.</p>
            <p><strong>Job Application Data:</strong> When you apply for a job on our website or via an employment agency, we usually collect your contact information (name, email, phone) and any information you choose to share with us in your introduction letter and Curriculum Vitae. If we decide to send you a job proposition, we will also ask you to provide extra personal details as required to fulfill our legal obligations and personnel management requirements.
              We will not ask you to provide information that is not necessary for the recruitment process. In particular, we will never collect any information about your racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious beliefs, trade union membership or sexual life.</p>
            <p><strong>Browser Data: </strong>When you visit our website and access our online services, we detect and store your browser language and geolocation in order to customize your experience according to your country and preferred language. Our servers also passively record a summary of the information sent by your browser for statistical, security and legal purposes: your IP address, the time and date of your visit, your browser version and platform, and the web page that referred you to our website.
              Your browser may also be used to store and retrieved your current session data, with the help of a session cookie (see also the Cookie section for more details).
              <br><br>
              Form protection: some forms on our website may be protected by Google reCAPTCHA. This technology relies on heuristics that are based on technical characteristics of your browser and device, and may also use specific Google cookies. See also Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Use in the Third Party Service Providers section below.

            </p>
            <p><strong>Customer Databases:</strong>When you subscribe to an Thrive Bereau ERP CRM Cloud service and create your own Thrive Bereau ERP CRM database (for example by starting a Free Trial), any information or content you submit or upload into your database is your own, and you control it fully.
              Similarly, when you upload an on-premises database to the Thrive Bereau ERP CRM Upgrade website, you own the data in it.
              This data will often include personal information, for example: your list of employees, your contacts and customers, your messages, pictures, videos, etc. We only ever collect this information on your behalf, and you always retain ownership and full control on this data.</p>
            <p><strong>Free Trial Session Recording: </strong>When you start a free trial on our Thrive Bereau ERP CRM Cloud service, you may be offered the possibility to consent to the recording of the beginning for your free trial session in order to help us improve the user experience of our products.
              If you consent, the information that is collected includes what is visible on the screen during the first 2 hours of your free trial, as well as your interactions with our apps (where you click, which menu you open, etc.). This data is consolidated in the form of a video that our User Experience experts can watch for a limited time.
              This will likely include some personal data such as names, emails, phone numbers, pictures, depending on what real-world information you input into your database during the recording period. Password fields and other sensitive fields are automatically excluded from the recording, but we cannot entirely exclude the possibility that some sensitive information may be recorded, depending on where you type it.</p>
            <p><strong>The other sections of this Policy explain:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li><a href="#">how we process this data,</a></li>
              <li><a href="#">how long we keep it,</a></li>
              <li><a href="#">and how you can access or request deletion of this data</a></li>
              <li><a href="#">and which third-party service providers are involved.</a></li>
            </ul> If you do not consent or if we do not offer you the option to opt-in, your trial session will not be recorded and no data will be collected for this purpose.</p>
            <p><strong>Github.com Account Data: </strong>When you subscribe to the Thrive Bereau ERP CRM.SH platform and create your project, the platform requires authorization to access your Github.com account, which includes an OAuth token granting access to your account, and later, the contents of your project repository.</p>
            <p><strong>In-App Purchase (IAP) Transaction Data:</strong>When you use Thrive Bereau ERP CRM on the Thrive Bereau ERP CRM Cloud or on your own self-hosted deployments, some optional "In-App Purchase" services may be active by default. This typically includes auto-completion features to help you quickly input client and supplier info, as well as integration with third-party service providers for sending and receiving SMS, paper letters, etc.
              When you use these services, with our without payment, some necessary transaction data is transmitted to Thrive Bereau ERP CRM Cloud services and have to be communicated to third-party services for the purpose of executing the service. You can find the detailed privacy policy for each service on the IAP Privacy Policy page.</p>

            <h2>How we use this information</h2>
            <p><strong>Account & Contact Data:</strong> We use your contact information in order to provide our services, to answer your requests, and for billing and account management reasons. We may also use this information for marketing and communication purposes (our marketing messages always come with a way for you to opt-out at any time). We also use this data in aggregated/anonymised form in order to analyze service trends.
              If you have registered to participate in an event published on our website, we may transfer your name, email address, phone number and company name to our local organizer and to the sponsors of the event for both direct marketing purposes and in order to facilitate the preparations and booking for the event.
              If you have expressed interest in using Thrive Bereau ERP CRM or otherwise asked to be contacted by an Thrive Bereau ERP CRM service provider, we may also transfer your name, email address, phone number and company name to one of our official Partners in your country or region, for the purpose of contacting you to offer their local assistance and services.</p>

            <p><strong>Job Application Data: </strong> We will only process this information for our recruitment process, in order to evaluate and follow-up with your application, and in the course of preparing your contract, if we decide to send you a job proposition. You may contact us at any time to request the deletion of your information.</p>
            <p><strong>Browser Data:</strong>This automatically recorded data is anonymously analyzed in order to maintain and improve our services. Google reCAPTCHA may also be used for security purposes, in order to prevent abuse of our services. In that case we only process the anonymous score that reCAPTCHA determines based on your browser and device.
              We will only correlate this data with your personal data when required by law or for security purposes, if you have violated our Acceptable Use Policy.
              
              </p>
            <p><strong>Customer Database:</strong> We only collect and process this data on your behalf, in order to perform the services you have subscribed to, and based on the instructions you explicitly gave when you registered or configured your service and your Thrive Bereau ERP CRM database.
              Our Helpdesk staff and engineers may access this information in a limited and reasonable manner in order to solve any issue with our services, or at your explicit request for support reasons, or as required by law, or to ensure the security of our services in case of violation of our Acceptable Use Policy in order to keep our services secure.</p>
            <p><strong>Free Trial Session Recording:</strong>The purpose of these recordings is to improve our products: they will be seen and analysed solely by our R&D Usability team, who will treat your data as strictly confidential information. By watching the recordings they will be able to see a tangible representation of a user’s first steps into Thrive Bereau ERP CRM and improve the User Experience accordingly.
              The recordings are processed and stored with tools provided by FullStory (cf. our list of service providers), under strict confidentiality terms.

            </div>
            <p><strong>Github.com Account Data:</strong>  During the configuration phase of your Thrive Bereau ERP CRM.SH project, the platform uses your OAuth token to setup the Github.com project you will use for Thrive Bereau ERP CRM.SH, including the necessary web hooks and deployment key to allow Thrive Bereau ERP CRM.SH to detect every commit you push to your project repository. The OAuth token is not stored and is deleted as soon as you close your Thrive Bereau ERP CRM.SH session, or after 2 days.
              The contents of your project repository is stored as long as your Thrive Bereau ERP CRM.SH subscription is active in order to provide the service itself.
              Our Helpdesk staff and engineers may access this information in a limited and reasonable manner in order to solve any issue with our services, or at your explicit request for support reasons, or as required by law, or to ensure the security of our services in case of violation of our Acceptable Use Policy in order to keep our services secure.</p>
            <p><strong>In-App Purchase (IAP) Transaction Data: </strong> You can find the detailed privacy policy for each service on the IAP <a href="#">Privacy Policy</a> page.</p>

            <h2>Accessing, Updating or Deleting Your Personal Information</h2>
            <p><strong>Account & Contact Data:</strong> You have the right to access and update personal data you have previously provided to us. You can do so at any time by connecting to your personal account on Thrive Bereau ERP CRM.com. If you wish to permanently delete your account or personal information for a legitimate purpose, please contact our Helpdesk to request so.

              At any time you can export a complete backup of your database via our control panel, in order to transfer it, or to manage your own backups/archive. You are responsible for processing this data in compliance with all privacy regulations.
              You may also request the deletion of your entire database via your control panel, at any time.
              When you use the Thrive Bereau ERP CRM Database Upgrade service, your data is automatically deleted after your upgrade was successfully completed, and may also be deleted upon request from you.</p>
            <p><strong>Free Trial Session Recording: </strong> You may contact us at any time to request access to or deletion of the recording of your trial session (see contact info below). Please remember to include the name or the URL of your database (e.g. mydatabase.Thrive Bereau ERP CRM.com) to allow us to retrieve your specific recording. Recordings are automatically destroyed after 2 months, so if your trial is older than that the data does not exist anymore.</p>
